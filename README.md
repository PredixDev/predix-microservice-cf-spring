Predix Microservice Template using Spring Rest Template
==============
 
Welcome to Predix Microservice CF Spring, a Predix Backend Microservice Template.  

Each Microservice Template project shares the following characteristics
* Test cases and test case framework 
* Externalized Properties files
* REST implementation and framework
* Cloud ready with a Manifest file
* Environment Aware for Local, DEV, QA, Stage, Prod
* Continuous Integration capable
 
## predix-microservice-cf-spring

This project is a cloud-ready microservice that demonstrates how to create [Spring Rest Template](https://spring.io/guides/gs/consuming-rest/) based Services.  You simply change the @RequestMapping url and begin adding your service implementation.  It has SpringBoot, Spring Profiles and Property file management configured and ready for local development vs. cloud deployment.  It is also set up for Test Driven Development with JUnit and Mockito.
 
## To Download and Push predix-microservice-cf

1. Download a [DevBox](https://www.predix.io/catalog/other-resources/devbox.html) and launch it in Virtual Box or install the [Dependencies](#dependencies)

2. [Prepare your environment](#preparation) and follow the steps below to get up and running on Cloud Foundry.   

3. Download the project  
  ```
  $ git clone https://github.com/PredixDev/predix-microservice-cf-spring.git  
  
  $ cd predix-microservice-cf-spring
  
  $ mvn clean package  
  
    note: mvn clean install may run integration tests against services you may not have set up yet
  ```
4. To load in eclipse (you may skip to 'Push to Cloud' if desired)  
  
  Vanilla [Eclipse](https://www.eclipse.org/downloads) or [Eclipse STS - Springsource Tool Suite(https://spring.io/tools/sts/all) are both supported
  ```
  $ mvn eclipse:clean eclipse:eclipse  
  
  File/Import/General/Existing Projects/Browse to predix-microservice-cf dir  
  
  Check the box 'Search for nested projects'  
  ```
5. Try it out locally  
  ```
  in Eclipse - Right Click predix-microservice-cf project / Run As / Application 
  in Eclise STS - Right Click predix-microservice-cf project / Run As / Spring Boot Application 
  
  Visit service at http://localhost:9092 - a Spring RestTemplate  
  
  ```
6. Push to cloud  

    Take a look at the [predix-microservice-cf manifest.yml](manifest.yml) which provides properties and instructions for [pushing cloud foundry apps](https://docs.cloudfoundry.org/devguide/deploy-apps/manifest.html)
  ```
  $ cf push  
  
  visit http://(cloud-url-here)/services/ping - get the url from the output of cf push  
  ```

## Troubleshooting
If you encounter a github acct/password issue then contact predixgithubaccount@ge.com.  

If you encounter a [corporate proxy issue](https://github.com/PredixDev/predix-rmd-ref-app/blob/master/docs/proxy.md#proxy), you might need to set up your env vars as required by your IT department.

If you encounter a maven or artifactory account issue, add your predix.io username and encrypted password to a maven ~/.m2/[settings.xml](docs/settings.xml) file on your laptop.  It should be setup already if in a [DevBox](https://www.predix.io/catalog/other-resources/devbox.html).

## Preparation
Predix Microservice CF accesses code repos at https://github.com/PredixDev.

The best experience is to use a [DevBox](https://www.predix.io/catalog/other-resources/devbox.html) which has all the tools and settings pre-installed.  
* In DevBox,  
	* add your <a href="https://maven.apache.org/guides/mini/guide-encryption.html">encrypted</a> predix.io username and password to the ~/.m2/<a href="https://github.com/PredixDev/predix-rmd-ref-app/blob/master/docs/settings.xml">settings.xml</a>
by replacing predixuser@ge.com with your Predix.io user and pass.

	* to avoid entering user/pass several times, run this command to cache it
	  ```
	  git config --replace-all --global credential.helper 'cache --timeout=7200'
	  ``` 
	* OSX: To enable Copy/Paste using Left Command key.  
	  ```
	    On Host: Please choose VirtualBox/Preferences/Input/Virtual Machine/Host Key Combination.  
	    Set to Right âŒ˜.  
	    On VM: Choose System/Preference/Keyboard/Layouts/Layout Options/Alt/Win Key Behavior/Ctrl is mapped to Win Keys(and the usual Ctrl keys)
	  ```
  
  >We have a second DevBox for GE employees which helps with corporate proxy settings.  

  >In your own IT environment you may need to configure the [proxy](docs/proxy.md) settings Environment variables within the VM or your own laptop.

* For non-DevBox users,  
	For users wanting to install all the tools, please reference the DevBox settings, and also ensure you have the prerequisites installed from Predix.io [Getting Started](https://www.predix.io/docs/?b=#Uva9INX3) documentation and the [RMD Reference App Dependencies](https://github.com/PredixDev/predix-rmd-ref-app#dependencies).  

	* add your <a href="https://maven.apache.org/guides/mini/guide-encryption.html">encrypted</a> predix.io username and password to the ~/.m2/<a href="https://github.com/PredixDev/predix-rmd-ref-app/blob/master/docs/settings.xml">settings.xml</a>
by replacing predixuser@ge.com with your Predix.io user and pass.

  	* to avoid entering user/pass several times, run this command to cache it
	  ```
	  git config --global credential.helper cache --timeout=7200
	  ```

## Dependencies
